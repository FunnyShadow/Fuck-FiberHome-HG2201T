## What's this?

This script will help you to fuck your FiberHome HG2201T gracefully and get all the details about it with just one command :D

## How do I use it?

1. fix some fries.

> Sometimes, the wrong vendors like to secretly change the storage location of `baseinfoSet.cgi` and think that this will prevent us from fucking them over, but we don't have to worry about this at all, you can use the following command to specify a new URL
```bash
python decode.py -u <URL of your baseinfoSet.cgi file>
```
